the service that hosts the com.lab126.services.EasterEggReceiver broadcast
receiver is non-standard (not listed as a known API) and is not in the
the exploits container since its something running as a standard system
service added by the non-google vendor. Thus, it is forwarded to
the CVM. This has no effect on adb on the host and the exploit fails.
